### The roles of synthesis

Several roles for synthesis in drug development:
1. Target Identification – _eg. ‘tag’ a bioactive drug to find its biological target_
2. Lead discovery – _eg. synthetic libraries_
3. Lead optimisation – _medicinal chemistry_
4. Investigational New Drug &rarr; Clinical Trials &rarr; Clinical Use – _process chemistry_

### 1. Target identification

Identify regions of molecule that can be altered without destroying bioactivity, then:
- A) immobilise on solid support, capture biological target then elute and identify, _or_
- B) incorporate a photoaffinity tag, expose to cells or lysate, irradiate, then identify ‘tagged’ biological target

Can also label with fluorescent or radioactive tag to study cellular or whole body distribution

### A) Immobilise Lead Compound

### B) Photoaffinity labeling

### Photoactivatable groups

### Aryl trifluoromethyl diazirines

- trifluoromethyl group suppresses diazo isomerisation
- _advantage_ of excellent chemical stability prior to photolysis
- _disadvantage_ – synthetic challenges

### Carbenes and nitrenes

- Photoaffinity labelling relies on photochemical generation of highly reactive (short-lived) intermediates

- Carbenes and nitrenes are commonly employed as they are highly reactive:
  - Uncharged, yet electron deficient – only 6 valence electrons
  - Typical reactions include X–H, C–H and C=C insertion

### Carbene reactivity

### Photoaffinity label or tag

- traditionally, radioactive labels have been used

- more recently biotin labelling has been favoured:

### Biotin tagging

- detected via strong complex with tetrameric protein avidin (_K_<sub>D</sub> ≈ 10<sup>-15</sup> molL<sup>-1</sup>)
  - affinity purification - avidin-immobilised matrix
  - chemiluminescent detection – generated by peroxidase conjugated to avidin
  - detection limit less than 10<sup>-14</sup> mol (comparable to radioisotopic methods)

- _Disadvantages:_ biotin group is polar and large – affects biological activity?

### Summary

Chemical probes (natural products / lead compounds linked to fluorescent or photoaffinity/biotin groups) can be used to identify binding proteins / localisation of active molecules within cells of interest, eg. cancer cells.
